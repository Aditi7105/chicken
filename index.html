    <h1>CHICKEN</h1>

    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">
            domesticated</a> junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
        species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and
        cock
        are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
        is a
        capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep
        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they
        were
        also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are
        broilers
        and for eggs are layers.</p>
    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.</p>

    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <h4>Social Behaviour</h4>
    <P>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[</P>
